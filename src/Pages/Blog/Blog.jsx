                                    Local state is data we manage in one or another component. Local
                                    state is most often managed in React using the useState hook. For
                                    example, local state would be needed to show or hide a modal
                                    component or to track values for a form component, such as form
                                    submission, when the form is disabled and the values of a form’s
                                    inputs.

                                <p className='font-semibold text-3xl mb-4'>Server state</p>
                                <p>
                                    Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated
                                    with our UI state. Server state is a simple concept, but can be
                                    hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.
                                    There are several pieces of state that must be managed every time
                                    you fetch or update data from an external server, including
                                    loading and error state. Fortunately there are tools such as SWR
                                    and React Query that make managing server state much easier.

                                    Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query
                                    parameters. URL state is often missing as a category of state, but
                                    it is an important one. In many cases, a lot of major parts of our
                                    application rely upon accessing URL state. Try to imagine building
                                    a blog without being able to fetch a post based off of its slug or
                                    id that is located in the URL! There are undoubtedly more pieces
                                    of state that we could identify, but these are the major
                                    categories worth focusing on for most applications you build.

                                <p>
                                    Global state is data we manage across multiple components. Global
                                    state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in
                                    our app, or in multiple components at least. A common example of
                                    global state is authenticated user state. If a user is logged into
                                    our app, it is necessary to get and change their data throughout
                                    our application. Sometimes state we think should be local might
                                    become global.

                                as intended. When done well, unit tests:

                                and performance, and so on. The variety of technology available
